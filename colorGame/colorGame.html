<h1>The Great Guessing Game</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Uses RGB colors
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The order matters
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            It will be responsive
        </li>
        <li>
            The color that is being selected is in the top (H1/Jumbo type section)
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The jumbotron starts with a default color (shade of blue)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Contains some random RGB color that needs to be guessed
                </li>
                <li>
                    Has the titles "The Great Guessing Game" with "RGB( SOME COLOR )" in the middle of the sentence
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            The main menus (below jumbo) will read "New Colors" and the Difficulty (Easy Hard) initially
        </li>
        <li>
            There are Easy (3 colors) and Hard (6 colors) modes
        </li>
        <li>
            This will be fully responsive with 'consistent' padding
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Think bootstrap grid and containers
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            After you guess wrong ..
            <ul>
                <li>
                    App will show "try again" in the center (between the new game and difficulty options)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Color tile will disappear
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can still keep guessing
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            After winning the game
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The jumbotron background color will change from the default (some shade of blue) to the RGB that was generated
                </li>
                <li>
                    New Game will become "Play Again?"
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
