$("div").css("background","purple");
$(".highlight").css("width","200px");
$("#third").css("border","orange solid 4px");
$("div:first-of-type").css("color","pink");
// $("div:first") will also work, but it's a bit slower than first-of-type because "first" is not a native css as opposed to "first-of-type"
